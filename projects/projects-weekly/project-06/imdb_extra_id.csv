1,"Liam Card, Ana Candia, Eva Redpath, David Bajurny",N/A,Canada,Alberto Diamante,,"Comedy, Music, Romance",English,N/A,"A corpse lies on a living room floor. Our leads, Alex and Sarah are desperately trying to figure out what to do with the deceased Punjabi man Roger. Sarah is in panic, Alex tries to calm her down. Meanwhile, they start debating whether Roger is dead and whether Punjab is part of India or Pakistan. Then, suddenly, the body disappears. We flashback to Alex and Sarah's childhoods, they've been friends since kindergarten, and through high school. Both are smart, adventurous and hilarious. As kids, they have both been traumatized: Alex by the fact that the only picture of him allowed in the house was his embryonic ultrasound image; Sarah by the fact that her parents were swingers. As teens, Alex and Sarah are pranksters in school (Sarah hands in her assignments in Sanskrit) and outside (importuning a parking officer who is ticketing a car that does not even belong to them). The two lose touch with each other after high school. Sarah travels to the orient, while Alex becomes a stand up comedian. Then, one day, at a party, Sarah and Alex meet again. Sarah thinks it's more than just a coincidence and decides that they should keep in touch. They start getting to know each other better. However, Alex has an issue with Sarah's belief in astrology, the supernatural and various ""esoteric"" creeds. He particularly objects to her having a spiritual guide or ""guru"" (Roger, the man from the first scene) who, in Alex's view, is a phony and only wants to have sex with her. Alex and Sarah fall in love and move in together. Their experiences take them through trials and tribulations (as when Alex is hired to write a musical based on the life of Saddam Hussein, complete with a chorus of dancing girls called 'Al-Qaedettes,' or when he wants to move into a haunted house, which is very cheap, but which Sarah refuses to set foot into). Flash-forward: back to the living room, with Roger's body on the floor. We find out that Roger had made a pass at Sarah, who then hit him, making him collapse. While Alex and Sarah argue over where Roger is from (India or Pakistan) the man recovers and runs away. Just as Alex had predicted, Sarah's ""guru"", turns out to be nothing more than a snake-oil salesman. This creates a rift between them and they split up. However, Sarah eventually realizes that Alex is her soul mate and the two end up back together again for good.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzA0NDE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM2NjE3NjE@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,14 Oct 2011,True,90 min,Love... and Other Reasons to Panic,movie,Alberto Diamante,2007,tt0979965,7.9,47

For this purpose he joined hands with stalwarts such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohandas Gandhi, but expressed his frustration, especially with Gandhi's slow and painstaking way of trying to win over the enemy with love.

Nevertheless he was permitted recruit Indian-born British soldiers prisoners of war, and this is how the movement began. He secretly married his German Secretary, Emily Sanken, and did earn the ire of the Germans, who wanted to keep their race pure (Caucasian). His efforts to take his army to India through Russia and Afghanistan were in vain as Adolf Hitler declared war on Russia.

And it was with the help of the Japanese that he marched an army of approximately 8000 troops, both men and women, against the might of the British. It was here that he was informed that he had become the father of Anita.

That joy turns to horror when Cameron mentions to the worldwide audience that Howard is gay, especially horrific to Howard as he is engaged to fellow teacher Emily Montgomery, a woman with self-esteem issues as she had battled weight issues most of her life before she lost seventy-five pounds for the wedding. Howard's life is totally disrupted as Hollywood media descends on Greenleaf in order to get Howard's story. The rest of Greenleaf also openly wonders if Howard is indeed gay, as he exhibits many stereotypical gay tendencies, such as being neat, and loving music, dancing, poetry and Barbra Streisand. His cause is not helped in that his and Emily's relationship has not yet been consummated. The one person not concerned is Emily, who trusts Howard. As Howard continues to deny being gay to his family, friends and colleagues, he begins to examine himself hypercritically if only because if others believe he's gay, there may be some merit to the claim, as well as because of an incident that occurs with Hollywood reporter Peter Malloy, who is doing a week-long piece on Howard leading up to his and Emily's wedding.

While she is still a trainee, Crawford does ask her to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a psychiatrist imprisoned thus far for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer, he who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as Buffalo Bill who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern US, all young women who are slightly overweight especially around the hips, all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her as a woman to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game with she having often to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes more dire turns when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin, the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin, which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine.

Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJiZDRmOWUtYjE2MS00Mjc1LTg1ZDYtNTQxYWJkZTg1OTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwNzk3NDc@._V1_SX300.jpg,PG,25 Feb 1983,True,191 min,Gandhi,movie,John Briley,1982,tt0083987,8.1,"174,566"

Having successfully invaded Poland the previous September and having forced the surrender of the last polish troops on or around October 6, 1939, the Germans are spending the winter of 1939 reorganizing their forces while certain members within the upper echelon of the Third Reich, operating without authorization from Berlin under a secret directive known the Panda-Syndikat (or Panda Syndicate), obsessively comb the countryside in pursuit of an artifact described by ancient Chinese texts as the source of an unfathomable dark magic that could bring about the end of the world. The Panda-Syndikat, a group that technically should not even exist, is lead by a rogue German Commander by the name of Mitternacht (a mysterious SS officer who, as far as the administration is concerned, does not exist himself), and he is closing in on a large piece to the puzzle. Mitternacht leads a party to capture the artifact from Bianca Yonac, the artifact's pledged protector, who promptly packs it up and sends it to ""relatives"" in Bucharest who are also pledged to protect it. The artifact comes into the hands of her nephew, the young Kazimierz Yonac, who brings it to England with him in 1940,. As the film continues, it is suggested that the terrorist cells of the Panda Syndicate are believed to disintegrate with the fall of the Third Reich. Mitternacht is apprehended in 1945, convicted of conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and sentenced to death by hanging. It is revealed that the artifact remains in the hands of Kazimierz, who immigrates to America in 1949. Over fifty years later, the focus of the film shifts to James Reeder (Jim to his friends), the hero of our dark comic-adventure. Reeder awakens, showers, and jumps in his truck, taking off for work. It is revealed that the artifact remains in the Yonac family, in the hands of Kazimierz's niece, Rachel, who is a Professor of Psychology with a University in Northern New Jersey. The film shifts to a classroom, where she is giving a lecture on dissociative fugue for an Abnormal Psychology class (her class is seen to be quite lively and inquisitive). As she is leaving, three of her students pester her to discuss topics for research papers. After she finally escapes her students, Rachel runs into a colleague of hers who is researching some items that were passed down to her as Executrix of her Uncle Kazimierz's estate. It is further revealed that her Uncle's passing was sudden and unexplained, occurring while he was on holiday in Buenos Aires. Lastly, through their conversation the audience learns that Rachel has just purchased an historic home, with the intentions of restoring it; however, she is having some difficulties due to the dilapidated structure and wiring of the house itself. James Reeder is on the job, fixing some faulty wiring for the professor they are attacked by a group that they can only identify as the Panda Syndicate. As Reeder struggles to understand the riddles of the Panda Syndicate, he comes to realize that our world is teetering dangerously on the edge of disaster (orchestrated by the mysterious Sorcerer Xiongmao and those who follow him) and that if the Panda Syndicate gets their hands on the artifact, a magical talisman of great power, which has somehow made its way into the hands of the young Professor Rachel Gehret, hell on earth will be unleashed. With the help of his best friends Ganaraj ""G"" Raman and Artie Bannister as well as an odd assortment of supporting characters, Reeder will take on the Panda Syndicate in Crazy Elk's most elaborate production to date.",http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNzIxODc4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkzMDYwMg@@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,17 Oct 2008,True,150 min,Fight the Panda Syndicate,movie,"Jason J.

Baxter has been working at Consolidated Life, an insurance company, for close to four years, and is one of close to thirty-two thousand employees located in their Manhattan head office. To distinguish himself from all the other lowly cogs in the company in the hopes of moving up the corporate ladder, he often works late, but only because he can't get into his apartment, located off of Central Park West, since he has provided it to a handful of company executives - Mssrs. Dobisch, Kirkeby, Vanderhoff and Eichelberger - on a rotating basis for their extramarital liaisons in return for a good word to the personnel director, Jeff D. Sheldrake. When Baxter is called into Sheldrake's office for the first time, he learns that it isn't just to be promoted as he expects, but also to add married Sheldrake to the list to who he will lend his apartment. What Baxter is unaware of is that Sheldrake's mistress is Fran Kubelik, an elevator girl in the building who Baxter himself fancies. In turn, Sheldrake has no idea of Baxter's own interest in Fran. And Fran, who is in love with Sheldrake, has no idea that she is only the latest in a long line of Sheldrake's mistresses, that Sheldrake has no intention of leaving his wife for her, and that the apartment belongs to Baxter, who she likes as a friend. As some of these facts come to light on Christmas Eve, one of the three makes a unilateral decision. That decision sets off a series of events over the course of the next week which makes each of the three examine what he/she really wants which in turn may be incompatible with the other two. They are helped along the way by Dobisch, Kirkeby, Vanderhoff and Eichelberger who are now feeling neglected as Baxter no longer needs their assistance in moving up, by Miss Olsen, Sheldrake's long serving secretary who was also once his mistress, and by Dr. Dreyfus, a physician and one of Baxter's many exasperated neighbors who believes Baxter is a playboy based on all the noise he hears in Baxter's apartment and the plethora of empty liquor bottles Baxter seems to be always discarding.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1OTc4MzgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE2NjgyMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg,APPROVED,16 Sep 1960,True,125 min,The Apartment,movie,"Billy Wilder, I.A.L.

The other goats demand that Mei use his friend to get details of the wolves plans or be exiled. Gav is threatened with death unless he uses Mei to get details of the goat's habits.

The journey was made possible by his infinite faith in his mission: the moral values he received from his mother: and courage, vision and determination he received from Guru Granth Sahib. With compassion in his heart he found energy that can move mountains and create miracles. The film is an important chapter in the history of post - partition Punjab.

The rich music score soaked in traditional punjabi sounds, Shabads, songs and the culturally rich rhythms emanate fresh waves of sound that the listeners will savour with delight. The tireless research done for the film makes it a very authentic and genuine attempt to recreate the life and the times of a penniless man who calls himself "" a humble sweeper at the footsteps of Gods abode"". He ferried an invalid for many years on his shoulders and over a span of time the burden of every helpless human became a garland around his neck. In his arduous journey he was joined by millions of altruistic human beings who supported his noble cause without knowing the sheer magnitude of the herculean task of the man who undertook it.

Upon his return to work following a heart attack, irrepressible barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, known as a barrister for the hopeless, takes on a murder case, much to the exasperation of his medical team, led by his overly regulated private nurse, Miss Plimsoll, who tries her hardest to ensure that he not return to his hard living ways - including excessive cigar smoking and drinking - while he takes his medication and gets his much needed rest. That case is defending American war veteran Leonard Vole, a poor, out of work, struggling inventor who is accused of murdering his fifty-six year old lonely and wealthy widowed acquaintance, Emily French. The initial evidence is circumstantial but points to Leonard as the murderer. Despite being happily married to East German former beer hall performer Christine Vole, he fostered that friendship with Mrs. French in the hopes that she would finance one of his many inventions to the tune of a few hundred pounds. It thus does not help his case when it is learned that Mrs. French changed her will prior to her murder with Leonard being the primary beneficiary of a £80,000 estate. Leonard states that he knew nothing about the will. Christine is apparently the only alibi Leonard has to his whereabouts at the time of the murder. The usual methods Sir Wilfrid uses to test his clients' guilt or innocence leads to him believing that Leonard is indeed innocent. As the trial progresses, the prosecution calls a surprise witness, one that could place a nail in the coffin of Sir Wilfrid's planned line of defense. As Sir Wilfrid gets deeper and deeper into the case, something doesn't quite sit right with him, although he doesn't know what it is. The primary questions become how far Sir Wilfrid will go to obtain evidence to acquit Leonard, and if he will ever discover why he feels that there is something odd about the case.",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MjgyNTUyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQzMDg0Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg,APPROVED,06 Feb 1958,True,116 min,Witness for the Prosecution,movie,"Agatha Christie (in Agatha Christie's international stage success), Billy Wilder (screen play), Harry Kurnitz (screen play), Lawrence B.
